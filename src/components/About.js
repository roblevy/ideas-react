      This is a demonstration of a simple React app.

      It includes some of the standard setup, like Webpack and Babel, and also a CSS framework called <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="blank">Bulma</a>. 

      The additional styling is done with SCSS, loaded using Webpack's <span className="is-family-monospace">sass-loader</span>.
